# 📤 Export/Import Backup System

## ✅ **Solution for iOS Data Loss**

Since iOS Safari PWAs sometimes clear localStorage, we've added a reliable backup system!

---

## 📥 **Files to Deploy:**

1. [**index-WITH-EXPORT.txt**](index-WITH-EXPORT.txt) → Save as `index.html`
2. [**main-WITH-EXPORT.txt**](main-WITH-EXPORT.txt) → Save as `main.js`

---

## 🎨 **What's Changed:**

### **Header Buttons (Optimized for iPhone 13 mini):**
```
[📥] [📤] [+ Add Book]
```

- **📥 Import** - Icon only, compact
- **📤 Export** - Icon only, compact  
- **+ Add Book** - Full button, primary action

**Both Import/Export are smaller and icon-only** to save space while staying easily tappable.

---

## 📤 **How Export Works:**

1. Tap **📤** button
2. File automatically downloads: `bookish-backup-2024-12-09-15h30.json`
3. Filename includes date and time
4. File saved to your iPhone Downloads or Files app

---

## 📥 **How Import Works:**

1. Tap **📥** button
2. Select your backup JSON file
3. Only imports NEW books (no duplicates)
4. Shows: "Successfully imported X books!"

---

## 🔄 **Recommended Workflow:**

### **After Importing Your 286 Books:**
1. Immediately tap **📤 Export**
2. Save that backup file somewhere safe (iCloud Drive, Files app, etc.)

### **Weekly/Monthly:**
- Tap **📤 Export** after adding new books
- Keep recent backup files

### **If Data Gets Cleared:**
1. Tap **📥 Import**
2. Select your most recent backup
3. Back to normal in 5 seconds!

## 💾 **File Storage Tips:**

**Good places to keep backup files:**
- ✅ iCloud Drive (syncs across devices)
- ✅ Files app → "On My iPhone" → Create "Bookish Backups" folder
- ✅ AirDrop to your Mac/computer
- ✅ Email to yourself

**File naming:** Backups are automatically named with timestamps:
- `bookish-backup-2024-12-09-15h30.json` = Dec 9, 2024 at 3:30pm

---

## 🎯 **Why This Works:**

- ✅ **Reliable** - JSON files don't get cleared by iOS
- ✅ **Fast** - Export/Import takes 2 seconds
- ✅ **Safe** - You control your backup files
- ✅ **No server needed** - Everything local
- ✅ **No monthly fees** - Completely free

## 📱 **Button Layout:**

**Desktop/Tablet:**
```
📥 Import    📤 Export    + Add Book
```

**iPhone (like your 13 mini):**
```
[📥] [📤] [+ Add Book]
```
Compact icons for Import/Export, full button for primary action.
